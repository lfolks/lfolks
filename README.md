### Hello World!

My name is Lloyd and as a Software Engineer, I aim to continue developing my skills in software development.

Currently I am leaning more towards web development and cloud management. I have been slowly advancing in this direction even while working on my Software Engineering degree.

I plan on showcasing my projects here and hopefully engage with other developers in expanding my journey in web development.
